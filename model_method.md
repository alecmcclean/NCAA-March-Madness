# Model Ideas

Logistic regression modelling whether Team A beats Team B.  P > 0.5 implies that Team A wins.

Possible Effects (not in order of priority):
- W-L
- Strength of Schedule
- Last game (recency issues)
- Length of last game * Time since last game.
- Coach (how good in tournament)
- Box Score Stats
- Location (?)
- Individual Player stats / importance.
